A Bash script for Linux systems that will download the latest Bing daily image and set it as the wallpaper for the GNOME desktop environment.

To run this script on startup, place 'bing.sh' and 'bing.desktop' in the folder '~/.config/autostart'. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.

This code has been tested and works on Ubuntu 24.04 with GNOME 46, and Fedora 41 with GNOME 47.
